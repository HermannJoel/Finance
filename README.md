# Project 2:CREDIT RISK MODELLING:Overview

 * 1. Problem definition: Given a borrower's characteristics, can we predict
      itsprobability of default

 * 2. Data: We use the lending club data set provided by Kaggle.The original data set can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

 * 3. Methodology:  
  `PD`(probability of defaut) using a Logistic regression
. `EAD`(Exposure at Default) Using a linear regression
. `LGD`(Lost Given Default) using a linear regression

 For our PD Model, The variable loan Status will be our target. The model will predict a customer's PD notably whether he has defaulted or not giving certains features.

 For the LGD Model. We need to calculate how much of a loan was recovered after the borrower had defaulted.To do so, our target will be the variable `Recovery`<br>.

 For the EAD Model, We have to calculate the total exposure at the moment the borrower defaulted compared to the total exposure in the past. The target will be the total recovery principal variable will be our target for this Model<br>
